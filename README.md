# Simple-Calculator
This code includes an HTML form with two input fields for numbers and a dropdown for selecting the operator. When the form is submitted, the PHP code processes the input, performs the calculation based on the selected operator, and displays the result. Error handling is also included to prevent division by zero and handle invalid operators.
